## Features

### üéÇ **Recipe Management**
- Browse a collection of built-in recipes with detailed instructions.
- Add custom recipes via text or image upload.
- View precise measurements and nutritional information for each recipe.

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ **AI Baking Assistant**
- Ask baking-related questions and get expert answers powered by a PythonAnywhere backend using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model.
- Sample questions include:
  - "What's the best temperature for baking bread?"
  - "How do I prevent cookies from spreading too much?"

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Precision Measurements**
- Convert vague units (e.g., cups, tablespoons) into precise gram measurements.
- Account for ingredient density and volume conversions.

### ü•ó **Nutritional Analysis**
- Calculate calories, protein, carbs, and fat for each recipe.
- Tailor recipes to dietary preferences (e.g., diabetic-friendly, low-carb).

### üìã **Real-Time Guidance**
- Step-by-step instructions for each ingredient.
- Contextual tips for handling specific ingredients (e.g., flour, butter, eggs).

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Settings**
